# SecureSoftwareSecurityProject
The Secure Software Security Project (SSSP) demonstrates the transition from an intentionally vulnerable web application (Software Security Project - SSP) to a fully secured version. This project highlights the identification and mitigation of common web vulnerabilities using best security practices.  
Features

Vulnerable Version (SSP):

Includes deliberate vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
Designed for educational and testing purposes.
Secured Version (SSSP):

Implements data sanitization and input validation to prevent malicious exploits.
Configures ModSecurity WAF for real-time web application protection.
Enforces security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options) for enhanced defense.
Technologies Used

PHP, MySQL
Apache Web Server with ModSecurity WAF
Purpose
This project serves as a practical example of identifying, understanding, and addressing web application security issues, providing a secure coding framework for real-world applications.
